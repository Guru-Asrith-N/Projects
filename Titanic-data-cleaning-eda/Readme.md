# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring the Titanic passenger dataset to identify key factors that influenced survival. The goal is to demonstrate practical data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis skills using Python.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)
- File used: train.csv
- Rows: 891 passengers

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Steps
- Identified missing values across features
- Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive missing data
- Imputed missing Age values using median
- Filled missing Embarked values using mode
- Encoded categorical variables for analysis

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed survival rate across gender and passenger class
- Studied age and fare distributions
- Performed correlation analysis on numerical features

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Fare showed positive correlation with survival
- Age had a moderate impact on survival
